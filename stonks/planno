## How do we find cheap calls that constantly fluctuate between a few cents?



1. "Buy" all the calls that are cheap (i.e. between 2 cents and 6 cents) - done

2. Continually check if those calls went up or down - done

3. Record for each "owned" strike, when it goes up and down - done

4. Loop over output and for each strike we "own", chart the price of the call over the day

5. For each chart count the amount of times the call does a full "bounce"

6. If we count a lot of bounces AND its currently on the low of the bounce then actually buy the call.

7. Resell when its at the top of the bounce
